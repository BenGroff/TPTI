**Trucker's Paper Trail Inc.**
https://www.truckerspapertrail.com/

This was my first true freelance web development project. I would appreciate any feedback regarding my code, UX design, SEO techniques, content, and anything else you can think of. This was also my first time learning about and implementing SEO techniques into my website so I would appreciate additional comments regarding that. I would love to hear what you think and am looking forward to learning more and growing my skillset through future projects.

What is it:
This is an updated marketing website for Trucker's Paper Trail INC. who is a company that manages paperwork and insurance within the trucking industry. They work on basically every aspect of the paperwork side of trucking.

The goal was to create a responsive and informational website with some additional interactive features. The main purpose of the site is to market the company and give information to its users in order to draw in additional customers, but there are also features like mailing list and contact forms to add some additional interaction between the business and the users.

In the future there is a goal to incorporate an ecommerce and profile / information sharing aspect to the website to give more potential for user interaction with the website and make some of the business processes more efficient.

Software Used:
* HTML
  - Duh
  - Some information was hardcoded and some was loaded dynamically using JavaScript.

* CSS
  - Custom CSS
  - Bootstrap 4
  - Iconic
  
* JavaScript / jQuery
  - Custom JS / jQuery
  - Basic Bootstrap JS / jQuery Files
  
* PHP
  - Simple Form - To Email function

**** I'm hoping to create a mySQL database for a mailing list and integrate that into their SalesForce database in the future. Or find a direct way to link the website's forms to the SalesForce database.
